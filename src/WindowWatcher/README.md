[![SDK](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/WindowWatcher?label=sdk)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/WindowWatcher/)

The Window Watcher SDK allows you to listen for changes to the current foreground (active) window on Windows devices. The SDK takes advantage of the `user32.dll` windowing APIs to get information about the current foreground (active) window on a device using P/Invoke.

## Getting started

### Get the SDK

If you want to build your own applications on the Window Watcher SDK, you can install the package into your dotnet application.

```bash
dotnet add package WindowWatcher
```

Or by adding the `WindowWatcher` package in your NuGet package manager of choice.

### Using the `ForegroundWindowWatcher`

The `ForegroundWindowWatcher` is a simple class that can be used to listen for changes in the current foreground (active) window on a Windows device providing a `Window` object with the window detail.

```csharp
using WindowWatcher;

var windowWatcher = new ForegroundWindowWatcher();

windowWatcher.WindowChanged += (sender, args) =>
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Window changed to {args.NewWindow?.Title}");
};

windowWatcher.Start();
```

**Note**, `ForegroundWindowWatcher` has an `IForegroundWindowWatcher` interface to ease the extensibility, testability, and support for dependency injection in your applications.

### Getting the current foreground (active) window with the `WindowHelper`

In addition to the watcher, the `WindowHelper` class has a `GetCurrentForegroundWindow` method that you can use to get a point-in-time reference to the current foreground (active) window.

```csharp
Window? currentWindow = WindowHelper.GetCurrentForegroundWindow();
```
